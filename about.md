		I'm an Indian web developer. That means I run a small web-based business that makes the world better.
		My main project is credmine.tk, the simplest profiling tool on earth.
		I'm super-close to launching a from-the-ground-up rewrite of it. Can't wait to show it to you.
I live in Bangalore &amp; Hubli with my parents and three sisters, in a house we built. I love meeting up with People From the Internet, so if that sounds like you, let's hang out sometime.

		Technology is my passion, and has always been since I was a kid. In particular, I have always been interested in programming, security, and all the technologies which nowadays make it possible to easily share information and communicate across the globe, namely the Internet.

		want to get together to talk about the web, technology or anything else that we may have in common, feel free to reach out. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy reading these pages!
